I'm a Senior Undergrad in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu).

I recently finished applying for PhD programs and hope to start my PhD in Fall of 2024! 

I am a research assistant at Visual Intelligence Studio under Dr. Yang Cai. My research currently focuses on HCI and computer vision for medical training. I am also interested in computer vision methods for **contextual computing** and **interactive robotics** for **accessibility**. More broadly, I am interested in computer vision applications in different fields, which can range from medical imaging to sustainability and conservation. 

Outside of research, I do street art, photography, powerlifting, and boxing.
