As of Fall 2024, I am a first year Masters student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu), with a focus in [Intelligent Systems, Robotics & Control.](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/intelligent-systems-robotics-control-impacted)

Previously, I was a research assistant at Visual Intelligence Studio under Dr. Yang Cai. My research  focused on HCI and computer vision for medical training. I am also interested in computer vision methods for **contextual computing** and **interactive robotics** for **accessibility**. More broadly, I am interested in **computer vision applications** in different fields, which can range from medical imaging to sustainability and conservation. 

Outside of research, I do street art, photography, powerlifting, and boxing.

Current movie recommendation: {Cemetery Man (Dellamorte Dellamore)}
